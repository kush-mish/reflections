When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
~ Keeping my work on a remote repository, would allow me to edit or work on my project from different system. And also it will allow other people to collaborate. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
~ It's better to have this control of pulling any changes so as to prevent any disturbances while working on any new feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
~ Forks are used to clone a repository of some other person, to your account. Cloning is used to copy the exact repository to your local repository with the commit log. Branches are used to give progress in different directions.Branches can be merged to one another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
~ Copying last known state of the remote can be useful because then it can be merged to the local master branch at any moment.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
~ Sending files containing codes or images of codes. Suggestions of code and working on different branches would be harder, but since I would then not need to know how to use git, that would be the easier part.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
~ Making changes in separate branch would allow me to work on a new feature of the project without disturbing the code in the master branch.
