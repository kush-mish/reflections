When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
~ Keeping my work on a remote repository, would allow me to edit or work on my project from different system. And also it will allow other people to collaborate. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
~ It's better to have this control of pulling any changes so as to prevent any disturbances while working on any new feature.
